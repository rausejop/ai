# Chapter 10.5: Student Capstone Project Presentations

## The Demonstration of Applied Mastery

Session 10.5 is the technological focal point of this course, dedicated to the showcase of the student-developed "End-to-End LLM Solutions." In this session, we transition from theoretical analysis to the practical results achieved in specialized domains. 

### Core Presentation Areas

Each capstone project must highlight technical excellence in five key areas:

1.  **Input Sophistication**: How the system handles "messy" real-world inputs—from the transcription of noisy audio using Whisper to the semantic parsing of complex legal PDFs.
2.  **Retrieval Logic**: Demonstrating the optimization of the RAG pipeline. Did the team use **Hybrid Search**? How was **Chunking** managed to maintain semantic context?
3.  **Agentic Reasoning**: Showing how the model uses tools or multiple steps to solve a problem. For instance, an agent that first searches a database, then writes a summary, and finally formats it into a specific JSON schema.
4.  **Strategic Alignment**: Presenting the results of fine-tuning. Comparing the "Before and After" performance of the base model versus the LoRA-adapted specialized version.
5.  **Quantitative Evaluation**: Using industry-standard frameworks like **RAGAS** or **LLM-as-a-Judge** to provide a numerical grade for the system's performance, safety, and factuality.

### The Criteria for Industrial Success

A project is considered "Production-Ready" if it successfully balances the three pillars of the specialized AI stack:
- **Factuality**: Does it provide citations? Can it admit when it doesn't know the answer?
- **User Interface (UI/UX)**: How the model's stochastic nature is handled gracefully (e.g., streaming responses and displaying source documents).
- **Maintainability**: Is the system modular enough that the underlying LLM can be swapped for a newer version (e.g., Llama 4) with minimal friction? The presentations today represent the first step in your career as an architect of the next generation of intelligent systems.
