# Chapter 10.4: Presentation Guidelines and Final Review

## 1. Presentation Template and Time Limits
As you prepare for the final Capstone Presentation, clarity and technical density are paramount. Your presentation should be structured as follows:
- **Problem Statement (1 min)**: Defining the specific industrial problem being solved.
- **Technical Architecture (3 min)**: Detailing your choice of LLM, embedding model, and retrieval strategy.
- **Demo and Verification (3 min)**: Showing the system in action and presenting your RAGAS or benchmark scores.
- **Q&A (3 min)**: Defending your design decisions.

## 2. Evaluation Criteria (Clarity, Innovation, Execution)
Your project will be evaluated against three professional standards:
- **Technical Execution**: How well did you handle chunking, prompt engineering, and the grounding of responses?
- **Innovation**: Did you implement advanced features like **Reranking**, **Hybrid Search**, or a specialized **LoRA Adapter**?
- **Industrial Viability**: Is your solution cost-effective, maintainable, and safe for enterprise deployment?

## 3. Final Q&A and Feedback Sessions
The final review is a critical stage for "Stress-Testing" your system. You should be prepared to discuss:
- **Failure Modes**: Where does your system struggle? (e.g., "The model fails for very short, ambiguous queries").
- **Privacy and Ethics**: How are you ensuring that user data is protected during the retrieval process?
- **Scaling Potential**: How would your architecture handle 1,000,000 documents instead of 1,000? 
This session represents your transition from an AI learner to a professional **AI Architect**, capable of leading the design and deployment of the next generation of intelligent enterprise systems.
